				Hi, I'm Ford Fishman. I work at Brandeis University as a Data Analysis Specialist. 
				I guide researchers through various stages of their projects as they learn computational techniques and pipelines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I do this through 1-on-1 consultations, as well as leading workshops on Python, R, Unix, and more. 
				I love solving computational problems and giving others the tools to do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm also interested in basketball analytics, particularly focused on the NBA. I have previously used <a href="/blog/2022/03/08/3pt-machine-learning">machine learning to predict future 3PT shooting performance</a>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I am interested in using NLP to analyze fan reaction to NBA games. I am also working to create metrics to 
				better quantify the collective 3PT shooting different lineups possess and seeing how predictive these metrics are of team success in the regular season and post-season.
