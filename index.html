			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Ford Fishman. Currently, I am a graduate student at Indiana University in the
				<a href="https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/"> Lennon Lab</a>. I study the ecology and evolution of bacteria
				through a computational lens. My work uses simulation techniques, such as agent-based models, to how the
				interactions
				among microbes change and evolve over time. I've also developed methods to study how the evolutionary
				rates of bacteria and archaea might constrain global microbial diversity.

			</p>

			<p>
				I am presently looking to move into a data science career. I love solving computational problems, and
				my work during my time in graduate school has taught me to be a better problem solver. I look forward
				to delving into data and using that information to make statistical inferences and predict future outcomes
				using machine learning algorithms.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm also interested in basketball analytics, particularly focused on the NBA.
				I'm interested in how to best project the development of NBA prospects that are in league or have yet to be
				drafted.
				Currently, I am interested in using machine learning approaches to project which prospects have the highest
				chances of becoming
				elite three point shooters. I am also working to create metrics to better quantify the collective 3pt shooting
				different lineups possess
				and seeing how predictive these metrics are of team success in the regular season and post-season. Stay tuned
				for blog posts!
