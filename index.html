	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, I'm Ford Fishman. Currently, I am a PhD student at Indiana University in the 
		<a href="https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/"> Lennon Lab</a>. I'm primarily interested 
		in how the coevolution between bacteria and their viruses is impacted by horizontal gene
		transfer, mutation rates, and spatial and temporal separation. At the moment, I am primarily using computational
		modeling to study these interactions, but I am hoping to soon test the results of my 
		models in the wet lab.

		I'm also interested in basketball analytics, particularly focused on the NBA. 
		I'm interested in how to best project the development of NBA prospects that are in league or have yet to be drafted. 
		Currently, I am interested in using machine learning approaches to project which prospects have the highest chances of becoming
		elite three point shooters. I am also working to create metrics to better quantify the collective 3pt shooting different lineups possess 
		and seeing how predictive these metrics are of team success in the regular season and post-season. Stay tuned for blog posts!
