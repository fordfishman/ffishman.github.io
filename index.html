	<h2>Microbial Ecology and Evolution </h2>
	<p>
		Hi, I'm Ford Fishman. Currently, I am a PhD student at Indiana University in the 
		<a href="https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/"> Lennon Lab</a>. I'm primarily interested 
		in how the coevolution between bacteria and their viruses is impacted by horizontal gene
		transfer spatial and temporal separation. At the moment, I am primarily using computational
		modeling to study these interactions, but I am hoping to soon test the results of my 
		models in the wet lab.
