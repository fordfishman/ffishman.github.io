    <h3>Marker Genes in Microbial Evolution and Ecology</h3>
    <p>
        Measuring microbial diversity through genomics is difficult due to the sheer number of <br>
        individuals and species in a given environment, as well as genetic heterogeneity. To <br>
        study the ecology of microbial communities, it is common practice to use marker genes, <br>
        such as sections of the 16S rRNA gene, as a sort of proxy of actual diversity.
