I am extremely excited to announce the launch of the CellOut podcast, featuring myself and my friend Derek DeVries. Each month, we will be going through <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/issue?id=10.1371/issue.pbio.v20.i01'>the latest issue of PLoS Biology</a>. Our goal is to make open access science digestible and understandable both for biologists and for laypeople.

This episode, we talk about the January edition of PLoS Biology, going into the perspective piece, primer, and one longer form discussion on a model of cognition evolution, along with brief overviews of other papers and some fun games to break things up. 

You can listen and subscribe to the pod on Spotify, Apple podcasts, or wherever else you listen to your podcasts.
