title: March Madness Bracket Generator

I am terrible at March Madness. I don't follow the NCAA at all except a bit during the tournament to see how poorly my bracket is doing (and check up on some NBA prospects). That's why I made a bracket generator. 

This applet uses power rankings from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-march-madness-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) for each team to calculate the probability of teams winning in head-to-head matchups. It also takes into account a team's performance. If an underdog is consistently beating teams ranked much higher than them, their power ranking will start to increase during their hot streak. 

Anyways, it's a nice tool to have to make a reasonable bracket even if you know nothing about the NCAA men's tournament. I've included the applet below, and you can also find it [here](https://fordfishman.shinyapps.io/bracket-generator/). Good luck out there!
