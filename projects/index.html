                    Interactions between species or strains can be considered mutualistic when each species 
                    benefits from the presence of the other. Mutualisms are very common in nature, such as 
                    the relationship between plants and their insect pollinators. In bacteria, one form of 
                    mutualism occurs when different strains produce resources that can be used by different strains. 
                    However, while receiving benefits from a mutualistic partner can increase growth of an 
                    organism, producing the benefits for that partner might be costly. These costs may inhibit 
                    the evolution of these mutualisms or perhaps lead to cheating, where some individuals receive 
                    the benefits of the mutualism without producing any costly resources themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dormancy, where certain individuals become inactive for some time, may help to stabilize 
                    these relationships. For instance, while the costs of mutualism may lead to a disadvantage 
                    when resources are abundant, the mutualism may still be beneficial when resources are scarce. 
                    A seed bank of dormant cells may allow mutualistic cells to persist when selection favors cheaters until 
                    periods where it favors cooperation. Additionally, environmental stochasticity can lead to 
                    extinction of one of the two partners by chance. A seed bank can drastically reduce this 
                    probability by maintaining a reserve of individuals of both partners. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To model situations where dormancy can help maintain cooperation, I developed two 
                    individual-based models (IBMs): one non-spatial, and one spatial. Both implement cells as 
                    the primary individuals, or agents, and these cells can be of two types existing in a single 
                    population. They both share a common resource and produce secondary resources that can only 
                    be used by the other cell type. Both implement stochastic processes and allow individuals to 
                    make decisions based upon their current attributes. For more information about implementation, 
                    please go to the project <a href="https://github.com/fordfishman/mutual-dorm">GitHub repo</a>. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    These models have shown that when two mutualistic species are capable of dormancy, they can 
                    coexist in the long-term despite extreme resource limitation. Normally, without dormancy, neither 
                    species can survive, and without cooperation, one strain will go extinct. With both dormancy 
                    and mutualism, both are maintained. In the future, both models will require thorough parameter 
                    sweeps to identify precise parameters where dormancy increases the probability of coexistence.

                    It is difficult enough to count up all of the animal and plant species on the planet. 
                    However, this task is even more challenging for microbes. Most bacteria that can be 
                    detected from DNA sequencing approaches cannot even be grown in the lab, and the vast 
                    majority of the globe has not been properly sequenced for its microbial content. While 
                    several attempts have been made to estimate the extent of present-day microbial diversity,
                    the estimations range from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>, and there is no way to 
                    directly test these estimates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One indirect way is to check the feasibility of each estimation. In order for there to 
                    be a trillion microbial species, there must have been enough time passed to generate this 
                    number of species. This is controlled by the speciation rate, the number of new species 
                    formed per million years, and the extinction rate, the number of species that go extinct 
                    per million years. The net result of speciation and extinction is known as the diversification 
                    rate. To reach a trillion species after 4 billion years, the diversification rate must be high enough. 
                    The converse is also true: if the diversification rate is too high, a million species might 
                    be too low of an estimate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this logic, I used estimates of diversification rates of bacteria to fit stochastic birth-death models. 
                    As there is no direct fossil record of bacteria, these estimates were taken from the 
                    symbiotic bacteria of insects that had fossil records themselves. I also used models that included 
                    global mass extinction events. Our results found that while the outcome of millions of species 
                    is marginally more likely than billions or trillions, many combinations of parameters can lead 
                    to even higher than trillions of species, even when accounting for mass extinction events. 
                    This study is currently being written up into a manuscript for submission for publication.

                    Bacterial hosts engage in antagonistic interactions with the lytic phages that decrease 
                    the survival of these hosts. To limit these negative interactions, bacteria must evolve 
                    ways to defend themselves and resist phage infection. This resistance can manifest itself 
                    in several forms: modifying the receptors phages need to attach, destroying invasive
                    DNA or RNA once inside the host (restriction modification, CRISPR-Cas), or even early cell 
                    death to prevent larger outbreaks (abortive infection).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These mechanisms are only a small portion of the vast array of ways bacteria can defend 
                    themselves against phage. Why do so many mechanisms exist? One potential explanation is 
                    the other side of this picture: phage evolution. Phage mutations that can overcome the 
                    defense mechanisms of their bacterial hosts confer advantages to these new mutants. 
                    These new mutations can lead to new responses in the hosts to combat these new and 
                    improved phage, thus starting a cycle of coevolution.

                    This coevolution is the focus of my eco-evolutionary simulation model currently called 
                    <a href="https://github.com/fordfishman/CommunityImmunity">CommunityImmunity</a>. 
                    In this model, host and phage strains are allowed to mutate and create new strains that 
                    may be phage-resistant or may have a larger host range. The demographic information of 
                    all strains is tracked and partially determines the frequency of mutation. I am currently 
                    using this model to explore the impact of increasing host and phage mutation rate on the 
                    outcome of each simulation and the mode of coevolution.
